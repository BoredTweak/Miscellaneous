# ThreeJS Demo

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

Specifically, the template was generated by running `npx create-next-app --ts`.

This project aims to demonstrate use of ThreeJS in a NextJS Typescript template.

## Prerequisites

### Node and NPM

- Installation details can be found [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- Node and NPM handle dependency management, packaging and serving.

## Getting Started

- Install dependencies via `npm install`
- Run the development server
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```
- Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
- You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

### Routing

- See [here for routing details](https://nextjs.org/docs/routing/introduction).
- Next.js provides a route for each file in the `pages` directory by file name.  
- `next/link` offers a `<Link>` element for routing between pages.

## Learn More

- [ThreeJS](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html)
- [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.
- The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
