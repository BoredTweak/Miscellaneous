# Kafka

This directory aims to collect spikes done around [Kafka][main-technology].

There is additionally a [docker-compose definition][docker-compose] to spin up an instance of kafka exposed on http://localhost:29092. Note that this may take a significant amount of computing resources as well as a few minutes to complete start-up.
