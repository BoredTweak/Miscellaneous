# Hello World

This project was generated through the template documented [here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/). Since the development environment is running ruby `3.0.2p107` we additionally ran `bundle add webrick` against the template.

- `jekyll new hello-world`

## Run Locally

- From a terminal instance in this directory run `bundle exec jekyll serve`.
