# Docker Compose

Docker Compose allows orchestration of multiple docker images through a single definition file. There is a significant use case for this technology as a means to automate dependencies in local development. See: [Local Testing in ChoreUI](ChoreHelper/README.md#Local-Testing).

For more specific information, refer to [the documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).
