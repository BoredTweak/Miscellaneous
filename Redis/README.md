# Redis

Redis is a in-memory data store which offers high performance data storage and retrieval. This makes it an excellent caching solution. 

A docker image for Redis [is hosted on Docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/_/redis) and a [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) is provided locally for any demonstrations in this repository. Alternatively, run `docker run -p 6379:6379 redis` to start up an instance of Redis exposed on port 6379.
