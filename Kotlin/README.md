# Kotlin

This directory contains [Kotlin][technology-main] specific projects. 

## Installation

On Windows I found the most effective way to install the kotlinc compiler was to look at [the official releases][technology-releases], then extract and add the `bin` directory to the PATH environment variable.

## Demos

- [A Hello World in Kotlin][hello-world]
- [Another Console application which handles user input][console-app]
