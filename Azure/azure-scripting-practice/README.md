# Az CLI Practice

This project aims to serve as practice with Az CLI as a means to deploy an app service.

## Running Locally

From a terminal instance open to this directory run either `deployAzure.cmd` or `initAzureResource.ps1`. This should deploy the SimpleApi, implement deployment slots, and perform a deployment slot swap.

**Note - the scripts may require a standard tier service plan which is NOT free**
